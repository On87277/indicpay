# Forem reports


* People with their first posts - Welcome them to DEV
* Posts that are not in English - recommend them to add a language tag:

Welcome to DEV!
Unfortunately DEV does not have a special way to indicate the language of the post. However, it might be a good idea to indicate the language using the regular tags. Just as it is done by the [Spanish](https://dev.to/t/spanish) posts. It will help people locate other posts in the same language and it might encourage the developer of DEV to add a feature where one could indicate the language of their article.


* People who have multiple posts in the last hour (or short period of time) - SPAM?
* People who have posted very soon (within minutes) of signing up - SPAM ?
