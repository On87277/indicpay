* Group posts by authors
* Show date of post and how much time has passed since it was posted.
* See and report how much overlap we have between the  items fetched now and the one we already had.



* People with their first posts - Welcome them to DEV
* Posts that are not in English - recommend them to add a language tag:

Welcome to DEV!
Unfortunately DEV does not have a special way to indicate the language of the post. However, it might be a good idea to indicate the language using the regular tags. Just as it is done by the [Spanish](https://dev.to/t/spanish) posts. It will help people locate other posts in the same language and it might encourage the developer of DEV to add a feature where one could indicate the language of their article.
