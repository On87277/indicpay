Always learning, applying what's state of the art and (more importantly) looking what's ahead with regards to tools and technologies. On this topic, I am currently extremely passionate about the Open Application Model (OAM), its Kubernetes implementation named Rudr and the Distributed Application Runtime (Dapr).\n\nFocusing on cloud-native software architectures for a variety of public cloud providers including Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform, Salesforce's Force.com, SAP HANA Cloud Platform and Pivotal Cloud Foundry. Observability and monitoring these environments is another important key aspect.\n\nApplication Modernization has always been a key topic (e.g. mainframe to client/server) and still holds true today (cloud migrations, re-architecture, etc.). A key area of expertise is the acceleration of these base application architectures by providing a model-driven approach based on best practices and patterns and code generation techniques using templates.\n\nAble to communicate on all organizational levels (from CxO to architects and developers). Experienced at gathering requirements from technical and non-technical subject matter experts. \n\nTechnical challenges\u00a0are the juice that gets me up and going. Tackling stubborn issues with creative solutions is what I\u2019ve made a career of. Passionate about technology and developing great software solutions.", "location": "Munich, Germany", "website_url": "https://www.kimpel.com", "joined_at": "Nov 23, 2020", "profile_image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--h3YPWbNt--/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,h_320,q_auto,w_320/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/profile_image/519398/5979e673-0f6e-40ae-8027-d9c7aef6e964.png", "article_count": 4}
